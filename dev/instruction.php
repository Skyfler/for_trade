				<div class="sub_title">DEFINITION of 'Manual Trader'</div>
				<div class="text">A trader who manually enters trades into a trading system without using computerized algorithms that enable automated order entry. In the frenetic world of trading, manual traders may be at a disadvantage compared to traders who use considerable computing power to exploit pricing anomalies in the markets. Also, manual traders may be more susceptible to trading on emotion compared to a trader relying strictly on a trading program.</div>

				<div class="sub_title">BREAKING DOWN 'Manual Trader'</div>
				<div class="text">Entering trades or orders manually into a trading system also increases the risk of incorrect or erroneous order entry, which can be fraught with disastrous consequences if the error is large. Currency traders therefore increasingly use automated trading systems that enable them to place orders and execute trades efficiently through an application programming interface (API).</div>

			<div class="instruction_item">
				<div class="sub_title">BREAKING DOWN 'Currency Day Trading System'</div>
				<div class="text">
					<p>Currency day trading systems can be either manual or automated. A manual system involves a trader sitting at the computer screen, looking for signals and interpreting whether to buy or sell. In an automated trading system, the trader "teaches" the software what signals to look for and how to interpret them.</p>
					<p>It is thought that automated trading takes the detrimental human element of psychology out of trading. Both automated and manual day trading systems and signals are available for purchase over the internet. It is important to note that there is no such thing as the "holy grail" of trading systems. If the system was a perfect money maker, the seller would not want to share it.</p>
